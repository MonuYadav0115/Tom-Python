# 1 
import random as rd

# 2 print randomm number in integer value 1 to 100


# print(rd.randint(1,100))


# 3 its print range trhouth number 1 to 10 only odd number 

# print(rd.randrange(1,10,2))


# 4 its give 5 random rumber each time different 

# for i in range(5):
#     print(rd.randint(1,100))


#  5 seed method give you same set of number every time 

# rd.seed(10)
# for i in range(5):
#     print(rd.randint(1,100))




# 6 choice method give a every time diffent of value in the list 


# l = ["a","b","c",10,12,1,5,2.9,True]

# print(rd.choice(l))


# if you want more than one number give you [rd.choices(k = 4)]


# l = ["a","b",22,3,21,True,221,11,323,]

# print(rd.choices(l,k=4))
