# What is list ---> List is ordered collection of Hetrogenous element it's Mutable Can have duplicates-example--> l1 =[1,2,3,3,4]

# list is creation of square bracket []

# 1 Reading data --- indexing and slicing 

# l1 = [1,2,3,4,6]
# print(l1)

# index 

# l1 = [3,6,9,12,15,18,21]
# x1 = l1[3]
# print(x1)


# Slicing

# l1 = [12,13,1,41,41,12,13,98,78]
# x1 = l1[3:6]
# print(x1)

# l1 = [1,2,3,4,56,7,8,9,10]
# x1 = l1[::1]
# print(x1)


# l1 = [1,2,3,4,56,7,8,9,10]
# x1 = l1[::2]
# print(x1)



# l1 = [1,2,3,4,56,7,8,9,10]
# x1 = l1[::-1]
# print(x1)   # -----> revers order



# l1 = [1,2,3,4,56,7,8,9,10]
# x1 = l1[4::-1]
# print(x1)



l1 = [1,2,3,4,56,7,8,9,10]
x1 = l1[-3:-7:-1]
