# Tuple Indroduction 

# What is tuple :-> Tuple is same as List but immutable 

# tuple = (1 , 2 , 3 , "zentrox" , 1.2 , 2+2x , true)

# t1 =()      #tuple 
# t2 = (3)    # it is not tuple it will think integer value add the , 
# t3 = (3,)   # tuple 
# t4 = 5,3,2,3,4,4 # it will think tuple
 


# 1

t1 = (1,2,3,4,5)
# print(t1)
# print(type(t1))

t2 = tuple([1,2,3,4,5,6])
t3 = tuple ("python")
t4 = tuple(range(1,5))
# print(t2)
# print(t3)
# print(t4)

t5 = ()
print(type(t5))

t6 = (3)
print(type(t6))

t7 = (7,)
print(type(t7))

t8 = 10,12,15,17,18 

print(type(t8))
